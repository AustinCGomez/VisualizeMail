# VisualizeMail
Goal: The goal behind this project is to utilize what I have learned in web technologies to create a simple web application using APIS. We will have a map that visualizes where your package(UPS, USPS, FedEx, etc) has gone throughout the world to get to your destination. The project itself will be made to resemble a open source project with a professional readme(in the future), extensive testing, and clean code. However, the project itself will be a demo and not an actual product.  ETA is 'eventually'
A demo-project for my first steps into web development.
